## Feature breakdown(click the titles for a demo!):
### [jumpCircle](https://youtu.be/7ypW-aABOy0):
After jumping once, you have 400ms to jump again to get a bonus height of 104u. This is only possible by jumping up stairs, ledges or through teleporters as it takes longer than 400ms to land normally.
This HUD widget visually indicates how much time you have to perform a second height boosted jump. 

### [healthArmour](https://youtu.be/T_yGkeS7p80):
Displays health and armour amounts, as well as colour indicators for armour type and health amounts.

### [weaponBar](https://youtu.be/5MBU0t4heEU):
Displays weapons/ammo and selected weapon.
